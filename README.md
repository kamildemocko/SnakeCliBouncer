# Snake CLI Bouncer

## Description
Fun little project to play with printing to STDOUT --

Snake is moving around inside a box.

I added randomness with food, the tail of snake grows as it eats it.

When the snake crosses its tail, this is detected and different ascii character is shown.

And colors.

And ... CLI arguments

## Symbols
✖ snake body (yellow)

∅ food (green)

∌ body crossing symbol (red)

\- empty space (gray)
